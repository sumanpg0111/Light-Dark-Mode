# Light-Dark-Mode
Light and Dark Mode Toggle Using HTML , CSS, and Javascript :

This project demonstrates how to implement a Light and Dark mode toggle on a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The toggle allows users to switch between two different color schemes: a lighter theme that is easier on the eyes during the day, and a darker theme suited for low-light environments or nighttime browsing.

Key Features:

HTML: Provides the basic structure of the webpage, including a toggle button that switches between light and dark modes.

CSS: Defines two separate sets of styles—one for light mode and one for dark mode. The color schemes include adjustments for background colors, text colors, button styles, and other elements to provide a visually pleasing experience in both modes.

JavaScript: Implements the functionality to detect and change between the light and dark modes when the user interacts with the toggle button. It listens for user actions and dynamically updates the class or data-theme attribute on the <body> element to switch between themes. JavaScript can also save the user’s theme preference to localStorage, ensuring that their choice persists across sessions.
